Sign Language Recognition System

Overview

This project implements a Sign Language Recognition System using three main files: `preparation`, `classification`, and `inference`. Each file serves a specific purpose in the sign language recognition pipeline.

Files

1. Preparation

The `preparation` file is responsible for processing and preparing the raw data for training the sign language recognition model. This includes tasks such as data cleaning, augmentation, and feature extraction.


2. Classification

The `classification` file contains the implementation of the sign language recognition model. It is trained on the prepared data to classify different sign language gestures.


3. Inference

The `inference` file is designed for making predictions on new sign language gestures using a pre-trained model. It takes an input video or image and outputs the predicted sign.

4. Model

A model file of Sign language recognition system
